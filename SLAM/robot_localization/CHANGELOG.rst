Changelog for package robot_localization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2.2.1 (2015-05-27)
------------------
* Fixed handling of IMU data w.r.t. differential mode and relative mode

2.2.0 (2015-05-22)
------------------
* Added tf2-friendly tf_prefix appending
* Corrected for IMU orientation in navsat_transform
* Fixed issue with out-of-order measurements and pose resets
* Nodes now assume ENU standard for yaw data
* Removed gps_common dependency
* Adding option to navsat_transform_node that enables the use of the heading from the odometry message instead of an IMU.
* Changed frame_id used in setPoseCallback to be the world_frame
* Optimized Eigen arithmetic for signficiant performance boost
* Migrated to tf2
* Code refactoring and reorganization
* Removed roll and pitch from navsat_transform calculations
* Fixed transform for IMU data to better support mounting IMUs in non-standard orientations
* Added feature to navsat_transform_node whereby filtered odometry data can be coverted back into navsat data
* Added a parameter to allow future dating the world_frame->base_link_frame transform.
* Removed deprecated differential setting handler
* Added relative mode
* Updated and improved tests
* Fixing source frame_id in pose data handling
* Added initial covariance parameter
* Fixed bug in covariance copyinh
* Added parameters for topic queue sizes

* Changed the way differential measurements are handled
* Added diagnostics

2.1.7 (2015-01-05)
------------------
