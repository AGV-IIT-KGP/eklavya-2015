      <!-- REP-105 (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html) specifies three principal coordinate frames: map,
           odom, and base_link. base_link is the coordinate frame that is affixed to the robot. The robot's
           position in the odom frame will drift over time, but is accurate in the short term and should be
           continuous. The odom frame is therefore the best frame for executing local motion plans. The map
           frame, like the odom frame, is a world-fixed coordinate frame, and while it contains the most
           globally accurate position estimate for your robot, it is subject to discrete jumps, e.g., due to
           the fusion of GPS data. Here is how to use the following settings:
             1. Set the map_frame, odom_frame, and base_link frames to the appropriate frame names for your system.
                  * If your system does not have a map_frame, just remove it, and make sure "world_frame" is set
                    to the value of odom_frame.
             2. If you are fusing continuous position data such as wheel encoder odometry, visual odometry, or IMU data,
                set "world_frame" to your odom_frame value. This is the default behavior for robot_localization's state
                estimation nodes.
             3. If you are fusing global absolute position data that is subject to discrete jumps (e.g., GPS or position
                updates from landmark observations) then:
                  3a. Set your "world_frame" to your map_frame value
                  3b. MAKE SURE something else is generating the odom->base_link transform. Note that this can even be
                      another instance of robot_localization! However, that instance should *not* fuse the global data. -->

      <!-- The filter accepts an arbitrary number of inputs from each input message type (Odometry, PoseStamped,
           TwistStamped, Imu). To add a new one, simply append the next number in the sequence to its base name,

      <!-- Each sensor reading updates some or all of the filter's state. These options give you greater control over
           which values from each measurement are fed to the filter. For example, if you have an odometry message as input,
           but only want to use its Z position value, then set the entire vector to false, except for the third entry.
           The order of the values is x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. Note that not some
           message types lack certain variables. For example, a TwistWithCovarianceStamped message has no pose information, so
           the first six values would be meaningless in that case. Each vector defaults to all false if unspecified, effectively
           making this parameter required for each sensor. -->

      <!-- The best practice for including new sensors in robot_localization's state estimation nodes is to pass in velocity
           measurements and let the nodes integrate them. However, this isn't always feasible, and so the state estimation
           nodes support fusion of absolute measurements. If you have more than one sensor providing absolute measurements,
           however, you may run into problems if your covariances are not large enough, as the sensors will inevitably
           diverge from one another, causing the filter to jump back and forth rapidly. To combat this situation, you can
           either increase the covariances for the variables in question, or you can simply set the sensor's differential
           parameter to true. When differential mode is enabled, all absolute pose data is converted to velocity data by
           differentiating the absolute pose measurements. These velocities are then integrated as usual. NOTE: this only
           applies to sensors that provide absolute measurements, so setting differential to true for twit measurements has
           no effect.

           Users should take care when setting this to true for orientation variables: if you have only one source of
           absolute orientation data, you should not set the differential parameter to true. This is due to the fact that
           integration of velocities leads to slowly increasing error in the absolute (pose) variable. For position variables,
           this is acceptable. For orientation variables, it can lead to trouble. Users should make sure that all orientation
           variables have at least one source of absolute measurement. -->

           that the relative parameter doesn't cause the measurement to be converted to a velocity before integrating it. If

      <!-- REP-105 (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html) specifies three principal coordinate frames: map,
           odom, and base_link. base_link is the coordinate frame that is affixed to the robot. The robot's
           position in the odom frame will drift over time, but is accurate in the short term and should be
           continuous. The odom frame is therefore the best frame for executing local motion plans. The map
           frame, like the odom frame, is a world-fixed coordinate frame, and while it contains the most
           globally accurate position estimate for your robot, it is subject to discrete jumps, e.g., due to
           the fusion of GPS data. Here is how to use the following settings:
             1. Set the map_frame, odom_frame, and base_link frames to the appropriate frame names for your system.
                  * If your system does not have a map_frame, just remove it, and make sure "world_frame" is set
                    to the value of odom_frame.
             2. If you are fusing continuous position data such as wheel encoder odometry, visual odometry, or IMU data,
                set "world_frame" to your odom_frame value. This is the default behavior for robot_localization's state
                estimation nodes.
             3. If you are fusing global absolute position data that is subject to discrete jumps (e.g., GPS or position
                updates from landmark observations) then:
                  3a. Set your "world_frame" to your map_frame value
                  3b. MAKE SURE something else is generating the odom->base_link transform. Note that this can even be
                      another instance of robot_localization! However, that instance should *not* fuse the global data. -->

      <!-- The best practice for including new sensors in robot_localization's state estimation nodes is to pass in velocity
           measurements and let the nodes integrate them. However, this isn't always feasible, and so the state estimation
           nodes support fusion of absolute measurements. If you have more than one sensor providing absolute measurements,
           however, you may run into problems if your covariances are not large enough, as the sensors will inevitably
           diverge from one another, causing the filter to jump back and forth rapidly. To combat this situation, you can
           either increase the covariances for the variables in question, or you can simply set the sensor's differential
           parameter to true. When differential mode is enabled, all absolute pose data is converted to velocity data by
           differentiating the absolute pose measurements. These velocities are then integrated as usual. NOTE: this only
           applies to sensors that provide absolute measurements, so setting differential to true for twit measurements has
           no effect.

           Users should take care when setting this to true for orientation variables: if you have only one source of
           absolute orientation data, you should not set the differential parameter to true. This is due to the fact that
           integration of velocities leads to slowly increasing error in the absolute (pose) variable. For position variables,
           this is acceptable. For orientation variables, it can lead to trouble. Users should make sure that all orientation

      <!-- This represents the initial value for the state estimate error covariance matrix. Setting a diagonal value (a
           variance) to a large value will result in early measurements for that variable being accepted quickly. Users should
           take care not to use large values for variables that will not be measured directly. The values are ordered as x, y,
           z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. Defaults to the matrix below if unspecified. -->
