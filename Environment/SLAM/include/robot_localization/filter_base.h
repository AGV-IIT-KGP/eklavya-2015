      //! Kalman filters and extended Kalman filters project the current
      //! state forward in time. This is the "predict" part of the predict/correct
      //! cycle. A Kalman filter has a (typically constant) matrix A that defines
      //! how to turn the current state, x, into the predicted next state. For an
      //! EKF, this matrix becomes a function f(x). However, this function can still
      //! be expressed as a matrix to make the math a little cleaner, which is what
      //! we do here. Technically, each row in the matrix is actually a function.
      //! Some rows will contain many trigonometric functions, which are of course
      //! non-linear. In any case, you can think of this as the 'A' matrix in the
      //! Kalman filter formulation.

      //! The transfer function is allowed to be non-linear in an EKF, but
      //! for propagating (predicting) the covariance matrix, we need to linearize
      //! it about the current mean (i.e., state). This is done via a Jacobian,
      //! which calculates partial derivatives of each row of the transfer function
      //! matrix with respect to each state variable.
